On a bike trip across America, where we traveled from California to Maine over the course of 10 weeks, averaging 75 miles a day to total 4,000 miles across the country, I encountered Jesus personally and was changed forever.</p><p className='text-lg mb-4'>This specific day on June 14th, our team of about 30 woke up before 5am to crank out over 82 miles of biking in the hot state of Arizona. Little did I know that morning that God was going to show how He truly is &quot;Immanuel,&quot; God with us.</p><p className='text-lg mb-4'>About every 20-25 miles on this bike trip, we had a rest stop where a support vehicle would provide water and food for us as we rode for hours each day. This ride, I wrote in my notebook, &quot;was the hardest ride of my lifeâ€”with over 6,000 feet in elevation gain and miles upon miles and serious heat.&quot;</p>"
